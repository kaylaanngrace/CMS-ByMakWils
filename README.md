## Description

My motive for this project was to display my newly gained SQL skills. This project was built as a CMS, to help track employees and their roles. 

## Installation

First clone the project in your terminal. Second run npm install to install all the packages. Then run 'mysql -u root -p' type in your password. Then run 'source db/db.sql'; source db/schema.sql; source db/seed.sql' after that run quit to exit mysql. Then run 'node server' and you will see the prompts.
